# Agent Resume — MyChat Integration & UX Polish (2025-09-13)

Author: AI Coding Agent (Codex CLI)
Branch: `release/integration-ux-sweep`
Scope: Chat wiring, UX polish across app, Settings layout, performance/accessibility guards, build script fix, simulator and device install.

## Summary
- Restored provider connectivity in Debug by fixing the DevSecrets.env copy path, enabling responses to render in Chat.
- Performed a UI/UX sweep: centered the composer, adopted liquid‑glass user bubbles, refined the dock, and card‑styled Settings.
- Added performance and accessibility guards to the animated background (Liquid Glass) and set safe defaults.
- Verified builds in iOS Simulator, installed to device (launch blocked only by locked device).

## What Changed (by area)

### Build & Secrets
- Updated Xcode Run Script “Copy DevSecrets.env (Debug only)” to copy from `NoteChat/Env/.env`, falling back to `MyChat/Env/.env`.
- Result: Keys prime the Keychain on first Debug run; Chat providers (OpenAI/Anthropic/Google/XAI) work without manual pasting.

### Stability
- Reworked SwiftData `ModelContainer` init to eliminate `try!`; added destroy‑and‑retry + in‑memory fallback to avoid launch crashes.

### Chat Screen
- Composer (InputBar): fixed vertical centering, 44pt field height, balanced padding.
- User messages: migrated to liquid‑glass bubble style for consistency and visual quality; removed stray inline “Edit” label (still in context menu).
- Model menu: corrected chevron orientation and kept quick model picker + full model sheet.
- Kept “jump to bottom” affordance and ensured overlays account for the dock.

### Navigation Dock
- Increased horizontal/vertical padding and slightly enlarged selection indicator for a more intentional active state.

### Settings
- Converted top actions (Providers, Default Chat) into rounded, ultra‑thin material “cards” with hidden separators.
- Normalized list row insets (16pt), improved section headers (“Interface”, “Defaults”), tuned spacing on toggles and sliders.
- Intensity slider shows a chip‑style percentage badge; rows feel tighter yet readable.

### Liquid Glass Background
- Respects Reduce Motion and Low Power Mode (adaptive complexity/speed/blur).
- Defaults: Liquid Glass OFF; WebCanvas OFF (both toggles in Settings remain available).

## Files Touched
- `NoteChat/Models.swift` — safer defaults (LiquidGlass/WebCanvas off).
- `NoteChat/LiquidGlassBackground.swift` — reduce‑motion/low‑power adaptivity.
- `NoteChat/MyChatApp.swift` — resilient SwiftData container init.
- `NoteChat/ChatUI.swift` — composer vertical centering and size.
- `NoteChat/ChatView.swift` — user bubble styling; removed inline Edit; fixed chevron.
- `NoteChat/RootView.swift` — dock padding and selection indicator size.
- `NoteChat/SettingsView.swift` — card rows, spacing, consistent insets and headers.
- `NoteChat-AI.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` — Debug build script: copy `DevSecrets.env` from correct path.

## Git History (this pass)
Branch created: `release/integration-ux-sweep`

Key commits (latest first):
- ui(chat): use liquid-glass bubble for user messages; remove stray Edit button; fix model menu chevron orientation
- ui(settings): tighten spacing, hide extra separators, card-style rows; consistent insets and section headers
- ui: improve nav dock padding and selection indicator sizing; center InputBar content
- fix(build): copy DevSecrets.env from NoteChat/Env or MyChat/Env in Debug; adjust InputBar vertical alignment and padding
- feat: production-safe UX defaults and resilience (LiquidGlass/WebCanvas off; reduce‑motion/low‑power guard; safe ModelContainer init)

## Verification
- Simulator: Built and ran `MyChat` scheme from `NoteChat-AI.xcodeproj` on iPhone 16; captured screenshots after UI changes.
- Device (OTA): Built and installed to “Kosta’s iPhone” successfully. Launch failed only due to device lock; will launch when unlocked.
- Unit tests: Present but test bundle linking needs cleanup (see “Next”).

## Obstacles & How They Were Solved
1. No responses rendering in Chat
   - Cause: Dev secrets weren’t copied into the bundle (script looked at `MyChat/Env/.env` while keys lived in `NoteChat/Env/.env`).
   - Fix: Updated the Debug copy script to prefer `NoteChat/Env/.env` (fallback `MyChat/Env/.env`). Keys now prime Keychain; providers authenticate.

2. Composer text not visually centered
   - Cause: mixed minHeight + vertical padding.
   - Fix: set fixed 44pt height with balanced padding to center text and icons.

3. Dock felt cramped and selection too subtle
   - Fix: increased padding and selection indicator size for clarity.

4. Liquid Glass performance/accessibility concerns
   - Fix: Reduce Motion + Low Power adaptivity; defaults OFF; intensity remains user‑controlled.

5. Risky `try!` in data store init
   - Fix: safe container initialization with destroy‑and‑retry, then in‑memory fallback.

6. Build DB lock during iterative builds
   - Fix: Cleaned project via xcodebuild; subsequent builds ran fine.

## Known Follow‑Ups (Recommended)
- Naming/structure unification
  - Decide on a single project (`MyChat.xcodeproj` vs `NoteChat-AI.xcodeproj`) and one top‑level app folder; migrate and remove duplicates.
- CI workflow
  - Pull in “Add GitHub Actions workflow for Swift project” (remote `origin/main`) and ensure simulator matrix builds pass.
- Tests wiring
  - Fix unit test target linkage (ensure app target is the tested host and module name matches). Then run and stabilize tests.
- Error UX
  - Add a small toast/banner when provider errors occur; surface “Add API key” CTA when keys are missing.
- Security hygiene
  - Run a full secret scan; rotate any historical keys; purge history if sensitive files were ever committed.
- Device build & launch
  - With device unlocked, relaunch app and do an on‑device smoke test (composer, send/stream, settings toggles, Reduce Motion).
- Code block controls (nice‑to‑have)
  - Add “Copy/Expand/Theme” controls on code blocks; refine Highlighter theme mapping.
- Accessibility pass
  - Verify Dynamic Type, contrast, VoiceOver rotor landmarks, and large content sizes across Chat and Settings.

## What’s Next — Pick One and I’ll proceed after reboot
- Option A: Launch to your phone and run an on‑device smoke test (composer, streaming, toggles). Requires the device unlocked.
- Option B: Wire and run unit/UI tests in CI; fix test bundle linkage and enable GitHub Actions.
- Option C: Unify naming/structure into a single project/target and remove duplicates.
- Option D: Add provider error toast + “Add API key” CTA in Chat.
- Option E: Run a secret scan and prepare a history‑purge + rotation checklist.

If you prefer a different focus, tell me and I’ll switch.
