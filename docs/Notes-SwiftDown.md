## SwiftDown Integration (Notes Editor)

Updated: 2025-09-14

This enables a fluid Markdown editing experience in Notes using the SwiftDown package, while keeping a safe fallback to the built‑in TextEditor when the package isn’t linked.

## What’s Already in Code
- `MyChat/NoteMarkdownEditor.swift`: a wrapper that prefers SwiftDown when available.
  - Uses `#if canImport(SwiftDown)` so it compiles even if the package is not added yet.
- `MyChat/NoteEditorView.swift`: now references `NoteMarkdownEditor` for edit mode and keeps the preview via our renderer.

## Add the Package in Xcode (UI only)
1) Open the project in Xcode.
2) Menu: File → Add Packages…
3) In the search field, paste the URL: `https://github.com/qeude/SwiftDown`
4) Dependency Rule: “Up to Next Major Version” (recommended) or pin a version you trust.
5) When prompted, ensure the package product “SwiftDown” is added to the app target (select your app target in the right pane).
6) After it resolves, check Project Navigator → your target → “Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content” to confirm “SwiftDown” appears.

Notes:
- No base files were modified for this integration. Only new Notes files reference SwiftDown.
- If the package isn’t present, the app continues using the fallback editor automatically.

## Customizing Look & Feel
- The wrapper applies a light/dark theme based on system appearance.
- To tweak spacing or theme, adjust `NoteMarkdownEditor` under the `#if canImport(SwiftDown)` section.

## Validation
- Build once after adding the package; the compiler should now include the SwiftDown code path.
- Open Notes → create a note → typing should feel responsive; preview remains available via the mode switch.

## Future Ideas
- Live split‑view preview.
- Slash‑commands for formatting.
- Hook the AI edit engine to apply diffs emitted by an AI panel.
