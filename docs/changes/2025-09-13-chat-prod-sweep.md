# Production Chat Sweep — Phase 1 (2025-09-13)

Branch: `feat/chat-prod-sweep-2025-09-13-231613`
Scope: Chat UX polish, navigation behavior, visual background

## Changes

- Input: Enabled autocorrect and sentence capitalization for the chat composer.
  - File: `NoteChat/ChatUI.swift`
  - Change: `.textInputAutocapitalization(.sentences)` + `.autocorrectionDisabled(false)` on `TextField`.
- Navigation: Opening a chat from Home now loads it in the Chat pane (not nested under Home).
  - Files: `NoteChat/ContentView.swift`, `NoteChat/RootView.swift`, `NoteChat/NavigationEvents.swift`
  - Mechanism: global `AppNavEvent.openChat(id:)` notification switches tab to Chat and selects the chat.
- Visuals: Added a lightweight “Liquid Glass” animated background behind the app content.
  - Files: `NoteChat/LiquidGlassBackground.swift`, `NoteChat/RootView.swift`
  - Implementation: `Canvas` + blur/alpha threshold, blended under app surface.
- History Drawer: Verified/retained left-edge swipe drawer inside Chat; opens/closes with spring + haptics.

## Rationale

- Autocorrect is expected behavior for text entry in production messaging apps.
- Opening chats from Home in the dedicated Chat pane unifies the UX and avoids nested navigation stacks.
- Subtle background motion (“Liquid Glass”) adds premium feel while keeping content readable.

## How to Test

1. Build: `xcodebuild -project NoteChat-AI.xcodeproj -scheme MyChat -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' build`
2. Launch app; on Home → Chat History, tap a chat: app switches to Chat tab and loads the thread.
3. Composer: type sentences with typos; autocorrect and capitalization should assist.
4. Swipe from the left edge in Chat: history drawer opens; select a chat; drawer closes and the chat loads.
5. Observe background: animated, subtle; should not interfere with legibility.

## Follow-ups / Next Phases

- Add a discrete “scroll to bottom” affordance when scrolled up.
- Group consecutive messages by role; show relative timestamps and message status.
- Drafts per chat; preserve partially typed input when switching threads.
- Optional enter-to-send toggle; long-press send for options (retry, regenerate, stop).
- Typing indicator + haptics; smoother insertion animations.
- Code block copy/expand controls and theme options.
- Accessibility: large content sizes, VoiceOver rotor landmarks, contrast checks.
- Settings: toggle for background animation and intensity.

## Phase 2 (2025-09-13) — Chat Production Polish

Features
- Settings → Enter to Send, Preserve Drafts, Animated Background toggle + intensity slider.
  - Files: `NoteChat/Models.swift`, `NoteChat/SettingsStore.swift`, `NoteChat/SettingsView.swift`, `NoteChat/RootView.swift`
- Draft preservation per chat (switching threads keeps typed text).
  - Files: `NoteChat/ChatComposerBridge.swift`, `NoteChat/RootView.swift`
- Scroll-to-bottom affordance when scrolled up.
  - File: `NoteChat/ChatView.swift` (MessageListView overlay)
- Group consecutive messages by role; relative timestamps per message.
  - File: `NoteChat/ChatView.swift` (MessageRow changes)
- Long-press on Send for quick actions; refine typing indicator.
  - Files: `NoteChat/ChatUI.swift`, `NoteChat/ChatView.swift`
- Expand response to full-screen sheet (for code/long content).
  - File: `NoteChat/ChatView.swift`

Testing
- Build: `xcodebuild -project NoteChat-AI.xcodeproj -scheme MyChat -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' build`
- Settings → toggle features and confirm behavior updates live.
- Type in a chat, switch chats, return: draft restored when enabled.
- Scroll up while streaming: “Bottom” pill appears; tap to jump.
- Inspect grouped headers and timestamps; expand assistant reply via button.

Notes
- Liquid Glass respects intensity and can be disabled. Default 0.40.
- Enter-to-send gated in `InputBar.onSubmit`; newline insertion available via Send button context menu.
- Next candidates: message reactions, per-chat pinning, export/share transcript, attachments tray, better code block controls.

## Phase 3 (2025-09-13) — Advanced Chat UX

Features
- Code blocks: inline actions (Copy, Expand), language label; selection enabled.

  - Files: `NoteChat/ChatView.swift`, `NoteChat/Models.swift`
- Export/Share transcript to Markdown via share sheet.
  - File: `NoteChat/ChatView.swift`
- Pin chats + search in history drawer; pinned sort to top.
  - Files: `NoteChat/Models.swift`, `NoteChat/RootView.swift`
- Accessibility: labeled composer controls; code and markdown text selection.
  - Files: `NoteChat/ChatUI.swift`, `NoteChat/AIResponseView.swift`

Build
- Verified simulator build: `MyChat` scheme (generic iOS Simulator destination)
