# Production Chat Sweep — Phase 1 (2025-09-13)

Branch: `feat/chat-prod-sweep-2025-09-13-231613`
Scope: Chat UX polish, navigation behavior, visual background

## Changes

- Input: Enabled autocorrect and sentence capitalization for the chat composer.
  - File: `NoteChat/ChatUI.swift`
  - Change: `.textInputAutocapitalization(.sentences)` + `.autocorrectionDisabled(false)` on `TextField`.
- Navigation: Opening a chat from Home now loads it in the Chat pane (not nested under Home).
  - Files: `NoteChat/ContentView.swift`, `NoteChat/RootView.swift`, `NoteChat/NavigationEvents.swift`
  - Mechanism: global `AppNavEvent.openChat(id:)` notification switches tab to Chat and selects the chat.
- Visuals: Added a lightweight “Liquid Glass” animated background behind the app content.
  - Files: `NoteChat/LiquidGlassBackground.swift`, `NoteChat/RootView.swift`
  - Implementation: `Canvas` + blur/alpha threshold, blended under app surface.
- History Drawer: Verified/retained left-edge swipe drawer inside Chat; opens/closes with spring + haptics.

## Rationale

- Autocorrect is expected behavior for text entry in production messaging apps.
- Opening chats from Home in the dedicated Chat pane unifies the UX and avoids nested navigation stacks.
- Subtle background motion (“Liquid Glass”) adds premium feel while keeping content readable.

## How to Test

1. Build: `xcodebuild -project NoteChat-AI.xcodeproj -scheme MyChat -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' build`
2. Launch app; on Home → Chat History, tap a chat: app switches to Chat tab and loads the thread.
3. Composer: type sentences with typos; autocorrect and capitalization should assist.
4. Swipe from the left edge in Chat: history drawer opens; select a chat; drawer closes and the chat loads.
5. Observe background: animated, subtle; should not interfere with legibility.

## Follow-ups / Next Phases

- Add a discrete “scroll to bottom” affordance when scrolled up.
- Group consecutive messages by role; show relative timestamps and message status.
- Drafts per chat; preserve partially typed input when switching threads.
- Optional enter-to-send toggle; long-press send for options (retry, regenerate, stop).
- Typing indicator + haptics; smoother insertion animations.
- Code block copy/expand controls and theme options.
- Accessibility: large content sizes, VoiceOver rotor landmarks, contrast checks.
- Settings: toggle for background animation and intensity.
